### Vagrant

- We're going to use a program called Vagrant to do this.
- Vagrant is a program that will run on the developers machine to create a "virtual" machine inside it.

> IMPORTANT NOTE : Try not to think that Vagrant is the only way to do this. It's just one of many possible tools we could use. But it's very common and very popular. This goes for every other tool we use too.

- We can control this virtual machine completely.
- We can install any operating system on it we like and it is kept completely separate and independent of the developer's machine.

Let's install Vagrant now. You can get the program from the following link for Mac, PC or Linux.
**Mac Users ** - system preferences of MacOS, in Privacy and Security, approve the update from Oracle.
[Install vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- Ensure to install vagrant version 2.2.7 as shown in below:

If you are running this on Windows, you will have to do the following things:

> * Make sure that if they have **Hyper-V** disabled. Check via **Turn Windows features on or off**, and disable it and restart if need be.
> * From this point onward to the end of the course, make sure they're **ALWAYS** running their terminal as an administrator, to make sure they have the rights to access whatever they need.

Once you have vagrant installed you can test it by opening a terminal and typing the following:

```bash
vagrant

# You should see the following

vagrant

`vagrant list-commands`.
```
- Check version of your vagrant on git bash
- ``` vagrant --version ```
# The next step is to install virtual box
- Please go to Virtual box folder in this repository for setup guide
